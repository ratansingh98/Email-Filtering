As you can tell from the proforma this project', 'should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.', 'This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as', 'Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for', 'this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we', 'have uncovered to date in the Austin market.', 'The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As', 'it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin', 'for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete', 'in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe', 'water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot', 'improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North', 'Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street', 'widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street', 'widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond', 'requirement, I used this data to be cautious.', ' The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not', 'expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite', 'successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the', 'adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.', 'As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods', 'is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may', 'only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far', 'preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer', 'preferences.', 'The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and', 'an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site', 'plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into', 'an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.', 'This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the', 'profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss', 'having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity', 'with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a', '1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a', 'rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then', 'be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an', 'exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San', 'Antonio if you do not know anyone.', 'I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,', 'by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.', 'Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to', 'schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as', 'your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any', 'time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either', '512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is', '512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you', 'on this project that is sure to be a major winner.', 'I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual', 'events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg', 'downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.', 'One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to', 'start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough', 'to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took', 'another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take', 'my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra', 'in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this', 'past week..

AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill ', 'passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of ', 'Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for ', 'community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be ', 'amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, ', ""currently in AB 8X.

', ' ', 'According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, ', 'Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money ', 'available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated ', 'that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  ', 'Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.

Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. ', 'March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand ', 'over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for ', 'temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates ', 'into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as ', 'compared with the previous year.', '', 'Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary ', 'reductions (as opposed to ""forced"" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other ', 'forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making ', 'total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.  ', 'This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple ', 'more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% ', 'decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the ', 'retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it ', 'is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last ', 'year.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in ', 'Jun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation ', 'are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of ', 'meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general ', 'economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least ', 'make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.', '', 'Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area ', 'only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC ', '(U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO ', 'portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in ', 'demand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As ', 'you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum ', 'smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at ', 'least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its ', 'wish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several ', 'mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are ', 'sharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly ', 'how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.  ', ""Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's "", 'economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of ', 'the WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I ', 'think we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already ', 'realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the ', 'non-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the ', 'WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around ', '6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.', '', 'I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you ', 'with updates as new or better information becomes available.

Crocker"" ', '<clclegal2@aol.com> ', 'Subject: Investment Structure', '', '', 'STRUCTURE:', 'Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)', 'general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the', 'liability of construction.', '', 'LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS', 'The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and', 'any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in', 'the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and', 'all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the', 'loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means', ""that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits"", 'is reduced.', '', 'All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are', 'full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,', 'the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be', 'non-recourse.', '', 'USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT', 'The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &', 'architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for', 'organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike', 'many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to', 'Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over', 'the estimated 6 month design and approval period.', '', 'EARLY LAND COSTS', 'The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost', 'represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of', 'extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at', 'probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase', 'price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated', 'monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus', 'approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.', '', 'EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN', 'Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require', 'the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as', 'the ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of', 'improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the', 'improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be', 'for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after', 'completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should', 'expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot', 'improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an', 'irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a', 'development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not', 'spent no interest is charged on these funds.', '', 'The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a', 'finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as', 'high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000', ""per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at"", '$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000', 'which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to', 'obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement', 'provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the', 'improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would', 'cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds', 'spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the', 'preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a', 'tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can', 'significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.', '', 'Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total', 'lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably', '$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The', 'improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design', 'costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and', 'landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for', 'undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would', 'estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the', 'loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give', 'you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required', 'of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing', 'is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the', 'separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility', 'standpoint.', '', 'CONSTRUCTION LOANS', 'There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative', '(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is', 'a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the', 'builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction', 'loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to', 'start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans', 'in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any', 'construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too', 'difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.', '', 'Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for', 'pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will', 'be from 80% to 95% of value.', '', 'DISBURSEMENTS', 'Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and', 'near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority', 'payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner', 'will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the', 'fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to', '15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.', 'These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to', 'calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership', 'expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has', 'to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or', 'cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this', 'function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain', 'from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.', 'Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is', 'used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own', 'any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track', 'to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.', '', 'REPORTING', 'We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.', 'What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based', 'reporting.', '', 'BOOKKEEPING', 'I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeeping', 'procedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.', '', 'INVESTOR INPUT', ""We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always"", 'the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my', 'experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume', 'Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every', 'effort to be accommodating.', '', 'CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES', 'CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as', 'formal as your question indicates.

The Democratic caucus is ', 'reportedly ""unwilling to fight"" for Davis.

Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and ', 'the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of ', 'the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  ', 'Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term ', 'power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the ', 'bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.

However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this ', 'concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full ', ""disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the "", 'details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they ', 'will support the bond issuance to go forward.', '', 'Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB ', '31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill ', 'passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of ', 'Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for ', 'community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be ', 'amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, ', ""currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should "", 'get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be ', 'likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy). ', ' ', 'According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, ', 'Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money ', 'available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated ', 'that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  ', 'Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The ', 'Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, ', 'Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and ', 'there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.', ' ', 'Key Points of the Bridge Financing', 'Initial Loan Amount: $4.125 B', 'Lenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B', '   Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B', '   Bear Stearns  $625 M', 'Tax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt', 'Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%', '   Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77%', 'Current Projected ', 'Blended IR:  5.38%', 'Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001', 'For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510', '', 'Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time', 'The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the ', 'California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.

Again, the Republicans are not in support of these ', 'authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the ', 'governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond ', 'amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to ', 'support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB ', '6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  ', 'for purchasing power.

According ', 'to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has ', 'signed it.

', '', 'The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond ', 'issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) ', 'stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, ', 'then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the ', 'state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and ', 'passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for ', 'bankruptcy.

Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. ', 'March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand ', 'over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for ', 'temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates ', 'into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as ', 'compared with the previous year.', '', 'Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary ', 'reductions (as opposed to ""forced"" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other ', 'forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making ', 'total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.  ', 'This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple ', 'more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% ', 'decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the ', 'retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it ', 'is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last ', 'year.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in ', 'Jun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation ', 'are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of ', 'meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general ', 'economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least ', 'make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.', '', 'Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area ', 'only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC ', '(U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO ', 'portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in ', 'demand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As ', 'you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum ', 'smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at ', 'least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its ', 'wish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several ', 'mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are ', 'sharply curtailing production.

', '', 'Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take ', 'precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price ', 'insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas ', 'prices before they soared. ', '', '""We\'re passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,"" said Paul ', 'Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy.

', '', ""A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per "", ""thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile "", 'to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by ', 'customers. ', '', 'But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand ', 'cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage ', 'for winter. ', '', 'There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, ', 'prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information ', 'Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating ', 'bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. ', '', 'But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, ', 'including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas ', 'markets. ', '', '""It\'s all about the weather,"" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. ', '', 'Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York ', 'traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile ', 'commodity in the world. ', '', '', 'Setting the price ', '', 'In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of ', 'gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading ', 'contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had ', 'widespread influence over gas prices. ', '', 'The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon ', 'as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale ', 'prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from ', 'utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what ', 'they pay for the gas they expect to use. ', '', 'There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention ', 'of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge ', 'of natural gas. ', '', ""But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to "", ""know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all "", 'futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to ', ""their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money "", 'in a short time. ', '', 'As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less ', 'than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. ', ""Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's "", 'weekly storage numbers. ', '', 'Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to ', 'need in the winter. ', '', 'Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than ', 'average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in ', ""hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. "", '', 'Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be ', 'sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the ', 'concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. ', '', 'Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage ', 'numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the ', ""association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. "", '', ""But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice "", ""president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had "", 'continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. ', '', '""I was getting worried,"" he said. ', '', ""Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. "", ""Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices "", 'dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. ', '', '', 'Just passing through ', '', 'Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but ', 'pass their fuel costs on to customers. ', '', ""Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas "", 'charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas ', 'Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. ', '', 'Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last ', 'month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could ', 'be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve ', 'energy. ', '', 'Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to ', 'save an average customer about $25 this winter. ', '', 'Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an ', 'extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not ', 'guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. ', '', 'Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left ', 'customers with such high gas bills.

Interesting."", '', 'Ken', '', 'Indigestion ', 'Daniel Fisher, Forbes Magazine, 10.29.01 ', '', 'All those new natural gas-fired electric plants mean more gas demand, right? Maybe not.', ""For natural gas bulls, there was never a surer sign of good times to come than the order book at General Electric Corp. Backlogs in GE's Power Systems group almost tripled to $25 billion in the late 1990s as scores of utilities and freestanding power producers ordered natural gas turbines to supply the nation's growing appetite for electricity. Gas demand had to go up as all those shiny new turbines were connected to the grid. "", '', ""Ah, but there was a flaw in that argument--one that is becoming glaringly clear as the price of gas plunges below $2 per million Btu at the wellhead from as high as $10 last year. (A million Btu of gas equals just about 1,000 cubic feet.) Those new gas plants were supposed to steal business from pollution-spewing coal units, which still supply half the nation's electricity. But in a painstaking study of 788 power plants that supply the bulk of U.S. electricity, Charles Studness, president of Studness Research, found quite the opposite could happen. "", '', 'Studness determined that 79% of the ""new"" electricity supplied to the grid over the past five years came from existing plants, mostly coal-fired units. And there\'s plenty more where that came from. Studness figures existing coal plants have the potential to increase output by 50 million megawatt-hours a year for the next five years, representing about half the expected 2.5%-a-year increase in demand. ', '', ""Coal's advantage over gas: It's cheap. Utilities paid an average of $1.20 per million Btu for coal last year, compared with $4.30 for gas (delivered). Even with depressed gas prices, many coal plants are still cheaper to operate. So while those new turbines being installed by Calpine (nyse: CPN - news - people) and other independent power producers, (see table, below) will burn a lot of gas, they will do it mostly at the expense of older gas plants that burn half again as much. "", '', ' ', 'Addressing a Burning Issue ', 'If natural gas prices stay down or merely remain volatile it will help companies that burn, trade or store gas and hurt those that sell it or provide equipment to the industry. Overleveraged gas producers and service companies could have trouble making it through the downturn.  ', '  ', '', 'WINNERS  \t\t\tSales* ($bil) \tRemarks ', ""Calpine \t\t\t\t$4.6 \t\tIts gas power plants won't compete with coal for years "", 'Chesapeake Energy \t\t0.9 \t\tHedged gas production through December 2003 ', 'Dynegy \t\t\t43.4 \t\tOwns gas, coal power plants; stores, trades gas ', ""Peabody Energy \t\t2.7 \t\tWorld's largest coal company "", '', 'LOSERS  \t\t\tSales* ($bil) \tRemarks ', 'Devon Energy \t\t\t3.3 Gas-heavy; \t$8 billion in ...debt  ', 'General Electric \t\t129.5 \t\tSells gas turbines ', 'Pioneer Natural Resources \t1.0 \t\t$1.5 billion in ...debt; 53% of production is gas ', 'Transocean SedcoForex \t1.9 \t\t$4 billion in debt; heavy gas-drilling exposure ', '   ', '*Latest 12 months. Source: Market Guide via FactSet Research Systems. ', '', '""It\'s not our game to compete with coal or nuclear,"" says Ron A. Walter, senior vice president of San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine, which plans over the next few years to build gas-fired plants totaling 31,500 megawatts. ""It\'s our game to displace older gas."" ', '', 'Combined-cycle gas turbines, which use hot exhaust gases from one turbine to generate steam to turn a second one, can transform 6,800 Btu of gas into a kilowatt-hour of electricity, enough to light one lightbulb for ten hours. The oldest gas plants burn as much as 13,000 Btu, and the national average is 10,500. Substitute enough new plants for old, and U.S. gas consumption, currently 62 billion cubic feet a day, could drop by as much as 1 billion cubic feet a day. ', '', 'That scenario sounds unlikely to Stephen Bergstrom, president of Houston-based Dynegy, an energy-trading firm that also owns both coal- and gas-fired power plants. Dynegy\'s 35-year-old coal plants are ""huge capital hogs,"" Bergstrom says, that cost ten times as much to maintain as modern gas units. Throw in the cost of scrubbers and other required pollution controls, and many smaller coal plants will have to be shut down, Bergstrom says. ', '', 'But coal-plant owners can be ingenious. Witness Midwest Generation, a nonregulated subsidiary of Edison International that bought six coal plants from troubled Commonwealth Edison of Chicago in 1999. By changing operating procedures and burning a higher grade of coal, Midwest boosted output from the 40-year-old plants 12% last year--while reducing emissions. John Long, vice president and chief technical officer of the Midwest Generation unit, thinks he can coax another 15% increase out of those aging boilers over the next five years without running afoul of environmental rules. ', '', 'Long term, the bullish scenario still holds: Gas will displace coal. In the meantime, gas producers have a lot of bonds to retire. ', '', '', '']"

Should I go with Shaun Alexander or 3 WRs and start Marty  Booker? Alexander ripped it up at home two weeks ago and he  is at home again versus a good Miami team, but Booker should  be featured more since Marcus Robinson went down for the  season.    Answer - GG     Alexander has been a revelation in his first two  starts, but now he faces a team that may not back down to  him. The Dolphins have a superb run defense that should not  be judged by its recent failures against Marshall Faulk and   Curtis Martin. Miami will be fired up to face Alexander, who  may have his first forgettable game as a starter. Booker  will face an underrated San Francisco secondary, and is not  destined to have a big day. Neither player seems like a  great start, but we recommend Alexander because he may score  a late TD if the Seahawks have to play catch-up against a  Miami team that gives them all kinds of matchup problems.  \t', '', '', ""  Question - Mark MacKay, San Diego, CA     Should I start Rod Gardner or  Ike Hilliard this week? Rod had a good Week Six, but Ike is  looking better each week.    Answer - GG     Gardner's huge day means two things. One, he gains  instant Fantasy notice. Two, his next opponent will be  geared to shut him down after extensive film study. The  Giants have been very solid defensively, and will be one of  the better units the rookie has seen so far. Hilliard is  quickly recapturing his old form, and might be the Giants'  No. 1 receiver if Amani Toomer is benched. He'll be facing  Champ Bailey though, so Hilliard is not due for a big week.  Neither player looks like a great start, but we'll go with  Hilliard because of his experience and continuing  improvement.  \t"", '', '', '  Question - John Kersey, Denver, CO     I have already decided to start LaDainian Tomlinson. Who should I start as my No. 2 RB -  Jason Brookins, Anthony Thomas or Mike Anderson?    Answer - GG     Brookins is the best back on the Baltimore roster, but  the Ravens are still not showing a lot of confidence in  him, so he is a risky start. It is difficult to sit Thomas  after the breakout game he had last week, but he will face a  respectable run defense. Anderson will start against a  Patriots team that has been surprisingly effective against  the run at times. In such a case, we recommend sticking with  the hotter player, and that would be Thomas.  \t', '', '', ""    Tip of the Week      Walter Mathis, Pompano Beach, FL: Remember that football is  a game that is fueled by emotion. Sometimes, emotions  override matchups. Curtis Martin will always rip holes in  the Miami defense. Lamar Smith will be fired up to face the  Seahawks this week, because he began his career in Seattle.  And in divisional games, big players do well. Don't be  surprised if Eddie George comes up big against Pittsburgh.  \t"", '', '', '  This message has been provided free of charge and free of obligation.

For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)  If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season.  If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup.  \t"", '', '', ""    Game-by-Game Analysis     Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season.

Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin Muhammad in week ten?    Answer - GG     Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with Muhammad.  \t"", '', '', ""  Question - Russell Brown     My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one  of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady,  Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.    Answer - GG     Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this  season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie  struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and  won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest  playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the  return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in  his last five games, and is playing too well to bench.   \t"", '', '', ""  Question - Chris Gilcrest     Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich  Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would  you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson,  Curtis Martin?     Answer - GG     Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but  he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like  Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar  performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a  solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike  Anderson.

Answer - GG     Griese's receiving corps has been crippled by injuries  this season, and with Rod Smith questionable with an ankle  injury, the outlook gets dimmer. The Denver QB has been  bothered by physical problems this year as well. Plummer  seems like a better choice after a superb Week 10 outing. But  remember that he was facing the 0-9 Lions, and Plummer has  never been able to string many good performances together in  the past. He will be facing a San Diego defense that will be  primed for a good performance after getting burned badly by  Oakland last week. Go with Griese, who should at least post  respectable numbers at Dallas.  \t"", '', '', ""  Question - Eric Fernau     Which three running backs should I start?  I  have Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Duce Staley, Priest  Holmes and Garrison Hearst.    Answer - GG     Dillon is a must-start player every week. Holmes is  facing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but  will have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside.  Staley should have little trouble ripping through the  Washington front wall. It's hard to ignore Hearst at  Indianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon,  Holmes and Staley, especially the latter in an NFC East game.  \t"", '', '', ""  Question - Jay Rassat     Who do I start this week at quarterback? I have  Tom Brady, Aaron Brooks and Trent Green. The defenses they  play against are all decent (N.O., N.E. and Seattle).    Answer - GG     Brady and Brooks square off against each other, and  each is facing a secondary that can give up the big play.  Green will be facing a Seattle team that won't offer much of  a pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady.

In addition, your response does not address Section 7.1.  This appears to be the relevant section if the PSA is to be paid in shares.

As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at', 'probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase', 'price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated', 'monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus', 'approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.', '', 'EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN', 'Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require', 'the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as', 'the ""fiscals"".

Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should', 'expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot', 'improvement construction.

The', 'improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design', 'costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and', 'landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.

Then the', 'loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give', 'you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required', 'of $241,000.

', '', '""Traders do that all the time; they\'re looking forward,"" said William Burson, ', 'a trader. ""It makes the market for natural gas."" ', '', ""But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas "", ""Association's director of gas supply and transportation.

', '', '""It\'s a little frustrating that they don\'t take the time to understand what ', 'we are reporting,"" McGill said.

', '', 'Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take ', 'precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price ', 'insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas ', 'prices before they soared. ', '', '""We\'re passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,"" said Paul ', 'Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy.

', '', '', 'Hot topic ', '', 'Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In ', 'many circles, little else is discussed. ', '', 'The Rev.

', '', ""A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per "", ""thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile "", 'to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by ', 'customers. ', '', 'But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand ', 'cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage ', 'for winter. ', '', 'There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, ', 'prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet.

Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, ', 'including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas ', 'markets. ', '', '""It\'s all about the weather,"" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. ', '', 'Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York ', 'traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile ', 'commodity in the world. ', '', '', 'Setting the price ', '', 'In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of ', 'gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading ', 'contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had ', 'widespread influence over gas prices. ', '', 'The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon ', 'as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale ', 'prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from ', 'utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what ', 'they pay for the gas they expect to use. ', '', 'There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention ', 'of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge ', 'of natural gas. ', '', ""But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to "", ""know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all "", 'futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to ', ""their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money "", 'in a short time. ', '', 'As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less ', 'than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. ', ""Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's "", 'weekly storage numbers. ', '', 'Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to ', 'need in the winter. ', '', 'Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than ', 'average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in ', ""hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. "", '', 'Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be ', 'sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the ', 'concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. ', '', 'Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage ', 'numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the ', ""association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. "", '', ""But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice "", ""president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had "", 'continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. ', '', '""I was getting worried,"" he said. ', '', ""Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. "", ""Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices "", 'dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. ', '', '', 'Just passing through ', '', 'Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but ', 'pass their fuel costs on to customers. ', '', ""Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas "", 'charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas ', 'Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. ', '', 'Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last ', 'month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could ', 'be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve ', 'energy. ', '', 'Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to ', 'save an average customer about $25 this winter. ', '', 'Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an ', 'extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not ', 'guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. ', '', 'Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left ', 'customers with such high gas bills.

Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. ', 'March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand ', 'over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for ', 'temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates ', 'into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as ', 'compared with the previous year.', '', 'Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary ', 'reductions (as opposed to ""forced"" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other ', 'forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making ', 'total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.  ', 'This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple ', 'more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% ', 'decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the ', 'retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it ', 'is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last ', 'year.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in ', 'Jun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation ', 'are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of ', 'meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general ', 'economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least ', 'make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.', '', 'Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area ', 'only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC ', '(U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO ', 'portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in ', 'demand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As ', 'you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum ', 'smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at ', 'least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its ', 'wish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several ', 'mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are ', 'sharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly ', 'how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.  ', ""Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's "", 'economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of ', 'the WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I ', 'think we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already ', 'realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the ', 'non-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the ', 'WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around ', '6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.', '', 'I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you ', 'with updates as new or better information becomes available.

The Democratic caucus is ', 'reportedly ""unwilling to fight"" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and ', 'Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the ', 'bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would ""double dip"" into ', 'the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and ', 'the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of ', 'the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  ', 'Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term ', 'power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the ', 'bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of ', 'contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge ', 'loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very ', 'difficult.', '', 'The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state ', 'would ""eat"" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General ', 'Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 ', 'billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this ', 'concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full ', ""disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the "", 'details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they ', 'will support the bond issuance to go forward.', '', 'Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB ', '31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill ', 'passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of ', 'Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for ', 'community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be ', 'amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, ', ""currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should "", 'get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be ', 'likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy). ', ' ', 'According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, ', 'Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money ', 'available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated ', 'that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  ', 'Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The ', 'Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, ', 'Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and ', 'there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.', ' ', 'Key Points of the Bridge Financing', 'Initial Loan Amount: $4.125 B', 'Lenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B', '   Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B', '   Bear Stearns  $625 M', 'Tax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt', 'Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%', '   Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77%', 'Current Projected ', 'Blended IR:  5.38%', 'Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001', 'For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510', '', 'Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time', 'The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the ', 'California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion ', 'authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be ', 'authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the ', 'additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing ', 'power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these ', 'authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the ', 'governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond ', 'amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to ', 'support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB ', '6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  ', 'for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  ', 'the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  ', 'be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this ', 'idea  earlier in the crisis.', ' ', 'SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy', 'At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The ', 'first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the ', 'governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is ', 'August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According ', 'to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has ', 'signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis ', 'and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates ', 'that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary ', 'bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  ', '', 'The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond ', 'issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) ', 'stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, ', 'then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the ', 'state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and ', 'passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for ', 'bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and ', 'the DWR proportionately from rate payments.', '', '']"
